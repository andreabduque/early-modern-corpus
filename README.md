Each book can be located as a csv file inside files folder. The name of the file for each book is located in the filenumber column in the metadata available. Each row from a csv is a word available in an unprocessed (standard) form, lemmatized or as a syntactic tag.

Sometimes lemmas and tags are not available because they were not present in the original XML form the data was retrieved.
